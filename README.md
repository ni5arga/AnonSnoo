## How to Use AnonSnoo

### Creating a New Anon Post

### Commenting on Others' Posts

Open the three-dot menu on the top-right corner of the post and click on "Post Anon Comment."

### Replying to Others' Comments

## Moderation & Logging

For transparency and moderation purposes, every comment & post passing through the bot is logged in modmail. It gets stored in the modmail of the subreddit where the user has used AnonSnoo to interact. Admins & Moderators can still see who is posting or commenting what.
